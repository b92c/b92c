## Public information ðŸ’¡

I am a senior software developer with 5 years of experience in web development and 3 years in cloud computing. During this time, I have specialized in building monolithic applications and REST APIs using PHP frameworks like Laravel. Additionally, I have 3 years of experience developing microservices and automations with Golang.

My technical expertise includes proficiency in hexagonal, clean, and event-driven architecture, along with design patterns for robust application development. I am skilled in implementing communication protocols such as gRPC and REST API, and I have worked extensively with SQL, NoSQL databases, and Elasticsearch for scalable data solutions. I also have experience with data streaming technologies such as Kafka and Amazon EventBridge.

On the infrastructure side, I have hands-on experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS Lambda. I am adept at implementing CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitLab, and I utilize tools like DataDog, Prometheus, and Grafana for application observability and monitoring.
